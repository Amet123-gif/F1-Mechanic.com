    <h3> Motori Sportiv</h3>
    <p>A motorcycle fairing is a shell placed over the frame of a motorcycle, especially racing motorcycles and sport bikes, to deflect wind and reduce air drag. The secondary functions are the protection of the rider from airborne hazards and wind-induced hypothermia and of the engine components in the case of an accident. A motorcycle windshield will usually be integrated into the design of the fairing.</p>

    <h3>Motori klasik </h3>
    <p>The Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic motorcycle (Model VN900B) is a mid-sized motorcycle cruiser made by Kawasaki, first introduced in 2006. The cycle follows the formula of a smaller yet capable engine fitted into a one-size up frame, a popular combination also in use by Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha in their respective cruiser lines.</p>

    <h3>Motori elektrik</h3>
    <p>lectric motorcycles and scooters are plug-in electric vehicles with two or three wheels. Power is supplied by a rechargeable battery that drives one or more electric motors. Electric scooters are distinguished from motorcycles by having a step-through frame, instead of being straddled. Electric bicycles are similar vehicles, distinguished by retaining the ability to be propelled by the rider pedaling in addition to battery propulsion.</p>

    <h3>Tash do ti tregoj disa nga makinat klasike,sportive dhe elektrike</h3>
    <h3>Makina klasike</h3>
    <p>A classic car is typically an automobile 25 years or older; however, definitions vary.[note 1] A common theme is that of an older car of historical interest is collectible and tends to be restored rather than scrapped, though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered a subset of a broader category of "collector cars," including restored classic cars and newer exotic vehicles. A subset of classic cars are known as antique cars, manufactured before 1980, or vintage cars, manufactured before World War II.</p>

    <h3>Makina sportive</h3>
    <p>A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and racing capability. Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1910s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.

      Definition
      Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance,[3][4] without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity",[5] or that emphasise the "thrill of driving"[6] or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track"[7] However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater"[8] or a car with two seats only.[9][10]</p>
